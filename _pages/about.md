I am a 4th year PhD Student at Department of Genomics and Computational Biology, University of Pennsylvannia. 

My PhD thesis lab is Dr. Nancy Zhang's lab at Department of Statistics and Data Science, University of Pennsylvannia.

My research interests are in understanding cancer development via <br/>
(1) inferring copy number variations in single cell and spatial omics data; <br/>
(2) lineage tracing with mitochondrial mutations in single cell and spatial transcriptomics; <br/>
(3) utilizing LLMs in single cell foundation models. <br/>
